1. Develop patches for security vulnerabilities

2. Send your patches to openEuler mailing list

3. Mark "v1, v2, v3 ..." in your patch subject if you have multiple versions
   to send out, and write the changelog below "---"

4. Upstream your kernel patch to kernel community is strongly recommended.
   openEuler will sync up with kernel master timely.
