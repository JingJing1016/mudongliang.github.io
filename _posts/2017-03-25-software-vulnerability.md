In the above classification of software vulnerabilities, memory safety violations is classified by spatial and temporal memory safety violation.

Buffer Overflow is spatial memory safety violations, while Dangling pointer is temporal memory safety violation. This is a coarse-grained classification for memory safety violations. Detailed classification for memory safety violations is as follows:

[Memory safety violations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety)

- Array bounds errors
	- [Buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)
	- [Buffer over-read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_over-read)
- Dynamic memory errors
	- [Dangling pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer)
	- [Double free](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Double_Free)
	- Invalid free
	- [Null pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer)
- [Uninitialized variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable)
	- [Wild pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pointer)
- Out-of-memory errors
	- [Stack exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow)
	- [Heap exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory)
